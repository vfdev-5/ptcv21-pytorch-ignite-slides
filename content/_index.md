# PyTorch-Ignite: what and why?

> High-level **library** to help with training and evaluating neural networks in PyTorch flexibly and transparently.

## Features

- Simple Engine and Event System
- Out-of-the-box metrics to easily evaluate models
- Built-in handlers to compose training pipeline
- Distributed Training support

---

# What makes Pytorch-Ignite unique ?

- Library at the crossroads of 
  - High-level Plug & Play features
  - Under-the-hood expansion possibilities

- Help to promote best pratices 
  - Using simple and coherent concepts
  - Transparently, without magic 
  
- Keep it simple and understandable
---

# Key concepts in a nutshell

- Engine
  - Loop over the user data
  - Apply an arbitrary user function on each data

- Event System
  - Customizable collections of Events
  - Emitting system of Handlers attached to Events

> Reactive programming concepts

---

# In its simplest form

```python
fire_event(Events.STARTED)
while epoch < max_epochs:
    fire_event(Events.EPOCH_STARTED)

    # run once on data
    for batch in data:
        fire_event(Events.ITERATION_STARTED)

        output = process_function(batch)

        fire_event(Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED)
        
    fire_event(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
fire_event(Events.COMPLETED)
```

---

# Do what you want !

```python
def process_function(engine, batch):
    # Do what you want ...
    # ... and return what you want

engine = Engine(process_function)

engine.run(data, max_epochs=50)
```

- A minimalist API for maximum freedom
  - Each Engine contains a sharable State to cache results and outputs

---

# When you want !

```python
@engine.on(Events.STARTED)
def handler():
    # Do what you want when you want !
    # here at every Events.STARTED event triggered by the engine's Event System
```

- Highly flexible and customizable 
  - Custom user Events
  - Event filtering 
  - Handlers can be lambda, objects, functions, methods

---

# Built-in Metrics

- Dedicated to many Deep Learning tasks
- Easily composable to assemble a custom metric 
- Easily extendable to create custom metrics

---

# Built-in Handlers

- Logging to experiment tracking systems
- Optimizerâ€™s parameter scheduling
- Smart checkpointing
- and a lot more !

---

# Distributed training made easy

- Run the same code across all supported backends seamlessly
  - backends from native torch distributed configuration: `nccl`, `gloo`, `mpi`
  - Horovod framework with `gloo` or `nccl` communication backend
  - XLA on TPUs via `pytorch/xla`

```python
import ignite.distributed as idist
```

---

# Distributed launchers

- Handle distributed launchers with the same code
  - `torch.multiprocessing.spawn`
  - `torch.distributed.launch`
  - `horovodrun`
  - `slurm`

```python
def run(_, config):
  # distributed function
  # Do what you want

with idist.Parallel(backend=backend) as parallel:
    parallel.run(run, config)
```

---

# Unified Distributed API

- High-level helper methods
  - `idist.auto_model()` 
  - `idist.auto_optim()` 
  - `idist.auto_dataloader()`
- Collective operations
  - `all_reduce`, `all_gather`, and more
